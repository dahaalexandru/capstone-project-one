<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
    My name is Alexandru Daha, and I'm 25 years old. I've been
    working as an Independent Registered Nurse (IRN) for almost 2 years now.<br />
    I recently decided to change my career path and learn Web Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. <br />
    This CV is my first HTML project done by myself. I currently seek a remote entry-level job, preferable in the IT department.
